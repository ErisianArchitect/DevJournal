### What I'm working on:
> I'm writing a little script in Python to generate Journal entries for me. And I'll probably also use the script to publish the entries. I'm procrastinating on my main project a bit, but that's healthy to do if you're working on a big project.
### Entry:
In order to generate a journal entry template that I can fill in with my journal entry, I needed to be able to display the date. The way I wanted to display the date would include the ordinal suffix on the day of the month, because I think it looks nice, but I wasn't sure if that was already built into the standard library, so I just implemented my own solution because it was a simple and fun problem to solve.

Here's what my template looks like (with some filler):
```markdown
# Saturday, June 17th, 2023
### What I'm working on:
> Recursion
### Entry:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
***
```
So I needed to be able to take an integer, `17`, and get the suffix, `th`. I set out to write the following function:
```py
def get_ordinal_suffix(n: int)->str:
    """Gets the ordinal suffix of a number.
    
    This is also called the ordinal indicator.
    It is the `st` on `1st`, the `nd` on `2nd`, and the `rd` on `3rd`."""
    match n:
        # Special case for 11th, 12th, and 13th so you don't get 11st, 12nd, and 13rd, lol.
        case n if n >= 11 and n <= 13:
            return 'th'
        case n:
            match n % 10:
                case 1:
                    return 'st'
                case 2:
                    return 'nd'
                case 3:
                    return 'rd'
                case _:
                    return 'th'
```
It utilizes Python's powerful match statement to easily get the suffix. Like I said, very simple problem with a simple solution.

###### *A short time later*
I realized that I wanted people to be able to view a sort of table of contents for my journal, so I'm working on making that very thing. I'm going to integrate managing the table of contents into the Python script that I'm working on right now. I'd also like to work on making a GUI application that I can use to compose my journal entries, and even submit those entries. I might even separate my journal into a separate repository. But it would make sense for me to keep this journal in this repository since this is the one that I'm working on, and I'd like for people to get a look into what is going on behind the scenes as I develop this large piece of software.

So shall we have a preview of what the June calendar may look like?
```markdown
| Sun  | Mon  | Tue  | Wed  | Thu  | Fri  | Sat  |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|      |      |      |      |  1st |  2nd |  3rd |
|  4th |  5th |  6th |  7th |  8th |  9th | 10th |
| 11th | 12th | 13th | 14th | 15th | 16th | 17th |
| 18th | 19th | 20th | 21st | 22nd | 23rd | 24th |
| 24th | 25th | 26th | 27th | 28th | 29th | 30th |
| 31st |      |      |      |      |      |      |
```
| Sun  | Mon  | Tue  | Wed  | Thu  | Fri  | Sat  |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|      |      |      |      |  1st |  2nd |  3rd |
|  4th |  5th |  6th |  7th |  8th |  9th | 10th |
| 11th | 12th | 13th | 14th | 15th | 16th | 17th |
| 18th | 19th | 20th | 21st | 22nd | 23rd | 24th |
| 24th | 25th | 26th | 27th | 28th | 29th | 30th |
| 31st |      |      |      |      |      |      |

The next step is to integrate into my script the ability to generate these months.

Oh, and it might also be useful to have each day of the month link to a journal entry, yeah? (at least if that day has a journal entry)

So, let's see what the code to generate a month might look like:

```py
# These are the imports that would be needed
# from datetime import datetime
# import calendar
# from typing import *

def format_date_table_day(day: int)->str:
    fmt = " {:>4} "
    day_ord = get_ordinal_suffix(day)
    return fmt.format(f'{day}{day_ord}')

def _adjust_weekday(weekday: int)->int:
    """The week starts with Monday according to Python, and
    this changes the start of the week to Sunday."""
    return (weekday + 1) % 7

def format_week(days: Iterable,*,formatter = None, none = '      ', strf = ' {:>4} ')->str:
    """
    Returns a line for a table for the following week.
    The iterable should return 7 elements.
    """
    def day_formatter(day: int | None)->str:
        match day:
            case int(day):
                return (formatter or format_date_table_day)(day)
            case str(day):
                return strf.format(day[:4])
            case _:
                return none
    return '|{}|'.format('|'.join(map(day_formatter,days)))

def create_calendar_month(year: int, month: int)->List[List[int | None]]:
    month_start, day_count = calendar.monthrange(year, month)
    month_start = _adjust_weekday(month_start)
    first_week = [*([None]*month_start), *range(1, 8-month_start)]
    next_week_start = 8 - month_start
    weeks = [first_week]
    for week_start in range(next_week_start, 32, 7):
        week_end = min(week_start + 7, day_count + 1)
        week_len = week_end - week_start
        none_days = 7 - week_len
        week = [*range(week_start, week_end), *([None] * none_days)]
        weeks.append(week)
    return weeks

def format_month(year: int, month: int, formatter: Callable = None)->str:
    # With the week day, we know where to start the first week of the month.
    year = year or datetime.now().year
    month_start, day_count = calendar.monthrange(year, month)
    month_start = _adjust_weekday(month_start)
    first_week = format_week([*([None]*month_start), *range(1, 8-month_start)], formatter = formatter)
    next_week_start = 8 - month_start
    weeks = [first_week]
    for week_start in range(next_week_start, 32, 7):
        week_end = min(week_start + 7, day_count + 1)
        week_len = week_end - week_start
        none_days = 7 - week_len
        week = [*range(week_start, week_end), *([None] * none_days)]
        next_week = format_week(week, formatter = formatter)
        weeks.append(next_week)
    return '\n'.join(weeks)
```
